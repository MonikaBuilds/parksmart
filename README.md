About the Project

ParkSmart is a smart parking management system developed to address the growing challenges of urban parking congestion and mismanagement. As cities continue to expand and the number of vehicles on the road increases, traditional parking systems become inefficient, time-consuming, and frustrating for users.

This web-based application provides a digital alternative to traditional parking systems by enabling real-time tracking of parking slot availability through a visual grid layout. It aims to simplify the parking experience for users and administrators alike.

The project allows administrators to log in securely and manage the parking lot, update the status of each slot, and maintain a clean digital record. Users can view the parking layout and easily identify which slots are available or occupied before entering the premises.

Why ParkSmart?

No more driving in circles looking for parking.

No dependency on physical guards or paper-based systems.

Scalable and customizable for any type of parking facility.

Whether it's a residential complex, hospital, shopping mall, or office building, ParkSmart can streamline the parking experience, reduce wait times, and improve traffic flow.
